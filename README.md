Adalight Net
============

A .NET client for Adalight - DIY Ambient Monitor Lighting Project Pack, which hardware and 'how to' is presented under http://www.adafruit.com/products/461.

This .NET client implements a Rainbow sample from Adafruits examples (http://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting/running-the-software).

**What is more**
* Display preview (arduino and adafruit hardware is not necessary)
* DirectX screen capture (works also in games - the game must be windowed).
* Some simple examples like linear gradient and solid color generator
* Grabbing color from currently displayed wallpaper
 
Still the project is not final - there are many bugs and not so clean code - but it works on my machine ;)

**Requirements**
* .NET 4

**Executables**

A zipped offline click once installer is available on my SkyDrive http://sdrv.ms/1bQWi24
